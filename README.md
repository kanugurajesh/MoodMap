## Background

In India, the availability of mental health professionals is critically low, with over 0.75 psychiatrists per 100,000 patients, far below the World Health Organization's recommendation of at least 3 psychiatrists per 100,000. This significant gap underscores the need for innovative solutions to address the mental health needs of the population.

## About MoodMap

MoodMap is a pioneering application designed to track and manage depression levels on a daily basis, providing users with awareness and support in their mental health journey. Drawing from my personal experiences with mental health challenges, I created MoodMap to offer a solution that can help individuals navigate their mental health with greater ease and accessibility.

## Key Features

1. **Daily Depression Tracking**: Users can assess their depression levels daily using the PHQ-9 test integrated within the app. This helps in monitoring mood patterns and identifying trends over time.

2. **Personalized Feedback**: MoodMap leverages the advanced capabilities of the Gemini model to provide personalized feedback based on the user's daily assessments, offering tailored advice and support.

3. **Affordable Psychiatric Monitoring**: Recognizing the high cost and limited accessibility of psychiatric treatment, MoodMap includes a patient monitoring system where a single psychiatrist can remotely monitor multiple patients. This feature significantly reduces consultancy costs and enhances the psychiatrist's ability to manage multiple patients efficiently.

4. **Critical Condition Alerts**: The app allows psychiatrists to set up alerts based on the PHQ-9 test results. If a patient is identified as being in a critical condition, the psychiatrist is immediately notified to provide timely intervention and counseling.

## Impact

MoodMap aims to address the shortage of mental health professionals by enabling a single psychiatrist to monitor multiple patients remotely. This not only makes mental health care more affordable but also ensures that patients receive timely and adequate support. The project aspires to build a community focused on tackling mental health issues, making a positive impact on both patients and psychiatrists.

## Conclusion

By bridging the gap between mental health needs and available resources, MoodMap offers a scalable and effective solution to improve mental health care accessibility in India. The integration of personalized feedback and remote monitoring positions MoodMap as a valuable tool in the fight against mental health challenges.
